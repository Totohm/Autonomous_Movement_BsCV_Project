**************************************** GOAL ********************************************

It permits to your turtlebot to move on its own and avoid all the obstacles on its path.

This package needs the information from the LIDAR. We use the LIDAR package from the LE2I
laboratory (lab from our teachers).

We are two students from BsCV (Bachelor in Computer Vision) based in Le Creusot (France).
This work is our robotic project of the 2nd semester.
